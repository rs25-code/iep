This Streamlit app leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the analysis and summarization of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). 

Designed for physicians, teachers, and parents, it simplifies the complex language and detailed information within IEP documents into concise, actionable summaries. By extracting key progress markers, goals, and accommodations, the app enables users to easily monitor a child's educational development and identify areas needing further attention.
